## 文章

{After I **had had** lunch at a village pub}[时间状语从句], I **looked for** my bag. 

 **had had** : 过去完成时

 **had** : had和eat是吃能吃饱的,take则不能

 **looked for** : 寻找

I had **left** it {on a chair}[地点状语] {beside the door}[定语] and **now** it wasn't there!

 **left** : leave的过去分词,过去式是left

 **now** : 那时

 **As** I was looking for it, the landlord came in.

 **As** : 引导时间状语从句.若作定语,后句将不完整

'Did you have a good meal?' he asked.

'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I **haven't got** my bag.'

 **haven't got** : 相当于有

The landlord smiled and immediately went out.

 **In a few minutes** he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

 **In a few minutes** : 在几分钟之内

'I'm very sorry,' he said. '{My dog}[主] {had taken}[谓] it[宾] {into the garden}[宾补].He often does this!'
