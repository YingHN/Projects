## 词汇

-  `lift` 搭便车;电梯 $n.$ 

-  `reply` 回答 $v.$

-  `on the way` 在路上

   `in the way` 阻碍,阻挡

   `by the way` 顺带说一下

-  `ask for a lift` 请求带我一程

-  `apart from` 介词短语,除了

-  `As[宾] I[主] soon[状] learnt[谓],he was English himself` 

   `as` 连接词作代词,代指后面的整个句子,所以本句相当于 `I soon learnt he was English himself`

## 文章

I had[谓] {an amusing experience}[宾] {last year}[状]. 

 **After** I **had left** a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town. 

 **After** : 后接一个 **时间状语从句** 

 **had left** : 过去完成时,时间点是最后的句子

On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. 

 **As soon as** he had got into the car, I **said good morning to him** **in French** and he replied in the same language. 

 **As soon as** : 一...就...

 **said good morning to him** :  `say sth to sb` 

 **in French** : in+ 语言,通过某种语言

Apart from a few words, I do not know **any** French at all. 

 **any** : 否定句或疑问句中 `some` 变为 `any` 

 **Neither of us**  spoke during the journey. 

 **Neither of us**  :  `neither of sb (=sb both didn't)` 两者都不,

I had **nearly** **reached** the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, ' **Do you speak English?** ' 

 **nearly** : 几乎

 **reached** :  `reach` 是及物动词

 **Do you speak English?** : 这是提问对方的 **语言习惯** 

As I soon learnt, he was English himself!
